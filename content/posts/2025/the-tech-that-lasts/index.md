A few months back my wife came home with a new Brother printer for the house.

This thing cost us £25 from a second hand store. Its ancient. It had sat unused for an age.

We got it working again with an hour of poking, oiling and a new ink ribbon. 

I love having things like this in my life, things that are repairable, things that age with me.

It got me thinking, what tech fits into this category? Here's my top items by age, newest first.

1. 2021 Thinkpad P1 running Linux.

    I need no more or less of a computer. It's great, keyboard and all. Hopefully, with some love, it'll make it to 2035 or beyond.

2. 2020 Moonlander Keyboard.

    Hot swappable switches are so good, you get bored or fancy a change, don't buy a different keyboard pop out the switches or change the key caps. 

3. 2017 Bose QC Headphone

    Props to Bose still shipping replacement ear pads, which I used in 2022 as they started to fall apart after years of long commutes and flights.

4. 2015 [UE Megaboom](https://uk.pcmag.com/electronics/38943/ue-megaboom)

    I remember when we got this as it was a wedding gift. It's great, no messing and just works. It's covered in paint from when we moved into and redecorated our first house and now its playing "Pink Pony club" for my 8 year old in the bath.

5. 2013 Xbox One Controller 

    This came with the beta hardware, was lucky enough to test it out before release. 

    It's been chewed by toddlers, dropped, stood on, lost under the sofa for months and ... it's just still going. 

    Now my grown up kids are using it to game.

6. 2010 Landrover Defender

    Of all the items in the list, this one has needed the most attention. We got it 2 years ago as a project and it's delivered. From rust to mechanical to electrical, it's needed love and I'd never worked on cars before getting it so been a steep learning curve.

    The things that's made it so much fun, is it's an oversized mechano set. Everything is bolts and you can get at (and fix) most things yourself at home. The community of owners, modder and manufacturers is great too. 

    Low point was when the door hing broke, then the door handle broke then the lock froze due to water ingress all on the same week. That said, 3 hours of work on the weekend and I'd taken the door off, fitted a new hinge and sorted the door handle.

7. 2006/7 Nintendo DS lite

    My mother in law found this when clearing out some stuff, I remember my wife having it when we were at school (we met there).

    Its charger was long gone, but quick search found one on ebay.
    
    After a charge, we popped in a game and it was back.
    
    Even the battery life was still pretty passable, our youngest played for a good few hours while travelling and loved the form factor.

7. [Unknown] Hermen Miller Aeron chair

    I picked this up cheap second hand. It'd clearly already seen some things. I have no idea how long it'd been around before it came to me, but clearly a while.

    I expected to have to repair stuff. It just hasn't needed it!
