Hi,

These have been a labor of love for me since the launch of Windows Phone in 2010 and it is with great sadness today that I removed both applications from the store.

I do not wish to comment any further on the matter except to thank the over half a million people who downloaded the application and all those who have supported, tested, rated and emailed over the years.

P.s.

Please feel free to leave a comment to cheer me up, jokes would probably help my mood.
