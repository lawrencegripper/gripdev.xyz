Hi,

I haven't really talked about stats very much for the application. I thought this would be a good time to do just that. Thanks to everyone who has downloaded the app and continues to use it. As always, get in touch with any and all feedback and hopefully we can continue to make the app great.

**Headline figures are 200k downloads and 2,000,000+ sessions (since using flurry).** Never expected this when I started working on this as a student, hasn't been without its problems recently but have lots of plans for the app going forward.

Below is a compilation of MS and Flurry Stats for the downloads and session stats.
