Hi All,

I've used flurry for a number of years to keep track on my apps as it give a great view of active users, sessions and can also be used for error reporting.

When I came to install it again today and couldn't find it on nuget I thought it was about time I made a nuget package.

Here it is:

[https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlurryForWindowsPhone8/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlurryForWindowsPhone8/)

So now you can install with just this:

PM> Install-Package FlurryForWindowsPhone8

Caveat - I'll do my best to update, if it's not do let me know!

If you haven't used flurry then do give it a look, very useful. Here is a snapshot from one of my apps.
