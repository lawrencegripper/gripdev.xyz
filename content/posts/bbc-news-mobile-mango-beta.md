Quick peak into my work so far on a mango version of BBC News Mobile

Features added so far:

- Double Sided Live Tiles
- Pin individual feeds to home screen
- Background service meaning improved live tile and breaking news notifications
- Background caching if wifi is available to speed up the app

If you would be interested in testing out the Beta and have a mango dev unlocked device get in touch via the comments section. Even if you can't test any feedback is always appreciated.
