Hi,

Right so this beta has one purpose.

**SPEEEEEEED.**

From my testing I've been able to, in most situations, half the loading time of the application. Took a lot of work in the back ground to get this all working so let me know if you spot anything that I've broken in the process.

Also I lied, I also tweaked the process I use to get pictures. So hopefully it will be picking a better picture to accompany each item.
