title: Abusive support requests, Really?

Hi All,

This is a bit of an odd one but today I got one of the most abusive support requests I've ever received and realised I've never really talked about these.

To clarify I'm all up for criticism of the app and suggestions on improvements, here I'm referring to out right abuse with terrible language and personal insults. While they're actually quite rare you'd be impressed that they do come through and they aren't pretty.

I bring exhibit A - This guy emailed me on Tuesday and having not received a reply by Wednesday sent this:

Thank
you for your reply.... Oh wait, you did not. You are a lazy f\*\*k and
should pull this app off the marketplace, 7.8 has been out a while and
you do not bother.. THIS APP DOES NOT
F\*\*KING WORK YOU LAZY FAT C\*\*T! Clear enough?

The really sad thing is that I'm working on a fix and I now know that this guy will benefit from It, despite being intensely abusive, its really frustrating!
