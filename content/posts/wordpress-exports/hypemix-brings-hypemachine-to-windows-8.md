Hi all,

I've just put the finishing touches to my new app that's been alive for a while now as a personal project. Over the last couple of weeks I've put in the final push to get it up to scratch and get it published.

If you're a current user of [http://hypem.com](http://hypem.com) or a fan of new music, then hopefully this will be right up your street. The app pulls together the latest music charts from The Hype Machine and combines it with artist information and images from [http://lastfm.com](http://lastfm.com). To bring it all together it's integrated into the audio api's in Win 8 to let it play around in the background and respond to skips commands etc.

If you interested in having a play, get it here [http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/f5e81d5d-b972-456c-9f33-655c23488815](http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/f5e81d5d-b972-456c-9f33-655c23488815). The trial is the full app, only buy it if you like the work I've put in and want to say thanks.

Also massive thanks to Anthony and the everyone at Hypem.com for letting me take a crack at this!
