Hopefully getting pretty well polished by now. New features and fixes include:

- Twitter fix - _spotted by [piaqt](http://twitter.com/piaqt) and [Matthieu Guyonnet-Duluc](http://www.facebook.com/Matthieugd)_
- Tile and Breaking news service fix - _spotted by fleon and [McFly](http://twitter.com/SeanLindo)_
- Long press on feeds for pin and remove on home screen, you may need to clear your current feeds for this to function correctly but didn't want to force this in case it was unnecessary - _suggested by Glenn and fleon_
- Added News mango share picker alongside current share options
- New cache Background service - When the phone is charging and connected to wifi it will cache all news items to enhance offline reading and speed
- Changes to backgrounds to enhance readability - _suggested by [derausgewanderte](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=15707108&postcount=2)_

Thanks for all the suggestions and feedback keep em coming! Might be a bit slower with the replies for the next month, as life is getting a bit more hectic, but will still be reading them all. New build is [available here](https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=7e4ec81dd074b459&resid=7E4EC81DD074B459!115), let me know how you get on.

Edit: Accidentally uploaded an old version, now fixed. Sorry for any hassle caused.
