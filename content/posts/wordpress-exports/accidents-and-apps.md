My computer met with a large quantity of pepi max last night. Currently the only working computer I have is my work machine, well this isn’t strictly true, I also have a very damp one that won’t turn on.

Aside from these ramblings and more to the point, this means that until I can save, order and build a new machine (and hopefully recover my data) I’m unable to continue work on the BBC News app. I know there is currently a minor bug around word wrapping on some pages, I was going to fix this over the weekend but I’m afraid this will now be delayed. If this bug is annoying you spare a through for my loyal computer which had now moved onto the graveyard of soggy electronics.
