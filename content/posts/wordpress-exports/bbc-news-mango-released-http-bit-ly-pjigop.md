It's had a couple of tweaks and some new features since the beta closed and moved to private testing so let me know what you think! Thanks again for all the help making the app better, your feedback and suggestions have been great, very much appreciated. Having a bit of a break now but v2.7 will be in the works soon so any ideas please pass them on.
