Thank you so much for all the interest in testing out the app. Rather that pick a few people I've decided to run an open beta on the condition that you all promise to give me lots and lots of feedback on the new features. Especially the background service in combination with pinned feeds and deep linking.

Few things to note:

- Before downloading please subscribe to the blog so that I can keep you up-to-date of any issues.
- Currently the initial load of the app isn't great, visually, this is something I'm working on.
- As with all beta software, the normal warnings apply, expect bugs and issues. If you find one please get in touch so I can get it fixed!
- Mostly I just want to hear your opinions and ideas for the app. Whether they are look and feed, usability or performance.
- The Beta will work until a new version is available for download or the 1st of September.

The xap is [available here](https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=7e4ec81dd074b459&resid=7E4EC81DD074B459!115). I look forward to hearing what you think!
