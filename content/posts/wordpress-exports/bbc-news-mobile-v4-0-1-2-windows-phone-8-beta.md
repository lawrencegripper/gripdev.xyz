Hi All,

Think this is very nearly there, if you see anything that you don't like/is a bug/shouldn't happen let me know! Looking to publish in the next couple of days.

## What's Changed:

- Voice. I made it chatty - say "BBC News read top news" and it will.

## Fixes:

- Settings page failed to save - Fixed - Thanks @ **mrlacey**
- NEW \- Settings page font size setting @mrlacey
- Live tile update issue - Fixed - Meee
- NEW \- livetile text wrapping issue thanks Mark Osborn & Jay bennett
- NEW \- offline run crash thanks Jay bennett
- Also thanks to Mark Osborn and Ed Harrison for their feedback

## What's Missing:

I plan to get most of these features back in the app, I'd really appreciate your help in prioritising.

- NEXT RELEASE \- Offline reading mode
- DONE \- "Next story" button when reading story (first on my hit list)
- DONE \- Share story
- NEXT RELEASE \- Secondary live tiles for sections

## Known issues:

- DONE \- Icons, when static, are defaults
- DONE \- No Welcome experience. User must use app bar to access settings & sections to setup live tiles, lockscreen and select feeds.
- STAYING \- Wide livetile contains full string date, this is just to help debug
- TESTED \- Suspend behaviour is untested.
- STILL FORGOTTEN \- Lots I've forgotten
