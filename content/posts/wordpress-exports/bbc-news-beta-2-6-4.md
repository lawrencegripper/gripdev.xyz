This is my latest build with a couple of new features and changes. I'm currently traveling so have been doing bits of bobs along the way on planes and in cafe's with free wifi. Hopefully haven't made too many mistakes. New Features Include:

- Scalable fonts via the app bar when reading an article
- Pivot for the feeds to allow easy change between feeds
- Changes to backgrounds and live tiles to improve the look and feel
- General tweaks to increase stability and Speed

As always let me know how you get on and if you have any suggestions. New build is [available here](https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=7e4ec81dd074b459&resid=7E4EC81DD074B459!115)

Also if anyone has a good suggestions of places to go/eat/see in Melbourne or Sydney let me know
