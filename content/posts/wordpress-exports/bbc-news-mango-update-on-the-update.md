Hi,

Got a lot of emails and I've been trying to reply to all of them but it's not feasible with the current volumes. Just put this post together to let you know what I'm working on and to apologize for not getting back to you all individually.

- Those got in touch with me regarding the notifications settings not being stored properly, I'm really sorry about this. An update is on the way and should be with you, if all goes well, inside a week. Please bear in mind that most of that time is going to be marketplace approval as I plan to publish the fix tonight.
- The limited numbers suffering from crashes, thank you for submitting the reports I will be including fixes in the update I publish tonight.

In short thanks for downloading the update and thank you for getting in touch with me, sorry about the group response.

Regards,

Lawrence

**Update:** Fix submitted for approval **.**
