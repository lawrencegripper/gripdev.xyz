Hi all,

For the Windows 8 Preview, I want to say a massive thanks to everyone who has been submitting feedback, I've had over 30 bug reports/feature requests and am starting to work through them all now. Keep em coming as I am reading them all and working on getting them into the app as soon as possible.

### Updates:

I've released update for both the Windows Phone, it needed it, and the Windows 8 Preview of BBC News Mobile today.

Neither of these are adding features, the main improvement is under the hood in the way the both applications read the articles. On the phone you should see less articles failing to display or displaying incorrectly, if all goes well. As always let me know how you get on with both the updates as I'm keen to hear that they're working well for you.

PS. when I say released I mean they're submitted to the store so hopefully should be available in a few days time.
