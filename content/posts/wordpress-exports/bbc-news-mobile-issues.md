Hi all,

So sat on the train back from London today I was frustrated to find that I couldn't read any articles on the BBC News Mobile app. This was swiftly followed by the realisation that I would have to fix this ASAP and the cancelling of my plans for the evening.

I'm going to look to publish a fixed version this evening and hopefully it will get through the certification process in the next few days. In the meant time please be patient and hopefully the app will be back up and running againÂ soon.

Kind regards,

Lawrence

**Edit 10pm**

Temp fix is in place and submitted to the marketplace, full update will be coming soon.
