Thanks for the continued testing. Hopefully the app is now getting nearer to the release candidate, although this is a more experimental build.

Changes in this build:

- Increased to performance
- Changes to feed Gui
- Improvements to the Offline reader
- Fontsize tweaks
- Screen orientation lock

Really interested to hear what you think of the new feeds gui on the home page, [get the latest xap here](https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=7e4ec81dd074b459&resid=7E4EC81DD074B459!115).
