A while back I applied to Microsoft’s MACH Scheme (graduate scheme) and was lucky enough to get offered a place. Only started on Monday but I'm already loving it. If you’re a student considering applying for graduate jobs I would strongly [recommend it](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/gb/gradhome.aspx).

P.s.

As I've started work and don't working internet connection at home (yet) I just wanted to quickly apologise for not getting back to people as quickly as I normally would. I will still get back to everyone who sends feedback but probably not until the weekends when I have some free time.
