title: Removal of Live Tile service supporting BBC News Mobile App

Hi,

Following the removal of the BBC News Mobile apps from the store I will be removing the service supporting the live tile functionality on Windows Phone 7.x and Windows 8.  This will be completed in two phases.

1. To avoid confusion, on these platforms, users will receive the following in place of the live tile.

1. The service will be disabled and no further updates will be delivered to the live tiles.

**If you have received this message please remove the live tile from your home screen and  disable the background task to avoid unnecessary data and battery usage on your phone.**

This is being completed as, on the older versions of the phone application, the live tiles are downloaded from a web service which I host. As part of the apps removal this service will be taken down. I have included the message to allow users time to remove the tile before the service is turned off.

This does not affect Windows Phone 8 as the tiles are generated by the app on a background service.

Lastly I'd like to say thanks to all those who have contacted me with your comments, support and jokes -  they are all much appreciated.
