title: Windows Store App - Infinite Scrolling list with Xaml

I recently came across a great interface and behavior in windows 8.1. If you implement ISupportIncrementalLoading on your bound property then bind up to a gridview you'll get infinite scrolling for free.

Below is an example from my HypeMix app where I pull in more tracks and add more to that list as the user scrolls, hopefully useful to others.
