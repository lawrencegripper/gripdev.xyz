  Hi All,

  I've been working like mad to try and get this one done and up to scratch. I set myself a deadline of Sunday for having a beta out to start getting feedback, while its not as complete as I'd like it would be great to get your opinions on it!

  **\*Updated\* link contains 4.0.1.1:**

  Fixes:

  - Settings page failed to save - Fixed - Thanks @ **mrlacey**
  - Live tile update issue - Fixed - Meee
  - Also thanks to Mark Osborn and Ed Harrison for their feedback.

  ## What's Changed:

  - **Everything! I've rebuild the app from scratch**
  - The old app was based off 2 year old code, written when I was back at University. It made me want to vomit so I've started again
  - New Shared core between WP8 and Windows 8
  - **Much** improved performance (hopefully)
  - Wide and Medium live tile support
  - Lock Screen support
  - In Pictures support
  - Improved layout (hopefully)

  Its not finished yet, full post has details on known issues, link to XAP and screenshots.

  Edit: Limited to those with dev accounts who can load XAPs.

Hi All,

I've been working like mad to try and get this one done and up to scratch. I set myself a deadline of Sunday for having a beta out to start getting feedback, while its not as complete as I'd like it would be great to get your opinions on it!

## What's Missing:

I plan to get most of these features back in the app, I'd really appreciate your help in prioritising.

- Offline reading mode
- "Next story" button when reading story (first on my hit list)
- Share story
- Secondary live tiles for sections

## Known issues:

- Icons, when static, are defaults
- No Welcome experience. User must use app bar to access settings & sections to setup live tiles, lockscreen and select feeds.
- Wide livetile contains full string date, this is just to help debug
- Suspend behaviour is untested.
- Lots I've forgotten

So if you've got some time have a play and let me know what you think! PS. keep in mind I started from scratch on the 21st, week and a bit ago, so things are going to have rough edges. The more you can spot and share with me the better!
