Hi All,

Just submitted an update for the BBC News Mobile app, this fixes the issues around live tiles. I'm going to hold my hand up to this one, it was a fault when moving between SVN and TFS. The backgroundscheduler code in the last version was actually from an older release and this caused the issues.

I've also added in a beta feature for related articles, this is to shut up my housemate - Dan, who has been hassling me to make this happen for a while! Let me know what you think, does it work well? Is it useful?

Hopefully be in the marketplace in the next week, once its completed certification.
